This is a simple guestbook application written with Appcelerator, completed as an assignment for a job interview.

The app allows users to view other signatures in the guest book, as well as adding and deleting entries, etc. I will leave the app here to serve as a reference/example for people new to Appcelerator like I was a week ago.

Here is a design document I wrote which details the app's functionality: http://goo.gl/BTjlMt
